                </div>
                <div class="trans-con">
                    <p>Modern popular culture promotes celebrity: people who are well known
                        for being well known. Stirring up controversy or scandal and then talking
                        or writing about it enhances celebrity status. Yet, the cult of celebrity does
                        not and cannot adequately explain the hold that a tiny nun from Albania
                        had, and retains, on the conscience of the world.
                        <br> <br>
                        For a woman who neither sought nor expected recognition, Mother
                        Teresa has exercised an enormous influence around the world. Her missionary work on behalf of the poorest of the poor in India was larger than
                        life, giving rise to questions about how her own experiences prepared her
                        to carry it out and to accomplish all that she did. By all accounts, Mother
                        Teresa was intelligent but passive and self-effacing. She had been an adequate but undistinguished teacher, a commonplace woman, and an ordinary nun, prone to knocking over candles during religious services. Yet,
                        Mother Teresa had one attribute that set her apart in a world often forgetful of God: a deep, abiding faith.
                       </p>
                        <p>In its appetite for a saintly celebrity, the media scrutinized every aspect
                            of Mother Teresa’s life and work. When charges of wrongdoing surfaced,
                            public opinion, the fickle engine that drives the cult of celebrity, turned
                            against Mother Teresa. Some were dismayed; others were angry and disappointed. Cynics everywhere rejoiced that another icon had been
                            smashed.
                            <br> <br> Common faults and foibles were magnified in the public persona
                            of Mother Teresa that the media now brought before the court of public
                            opinion. How could a saint also be stubborn, controlling, and unrealistic?
                            Perhaps Mother Teresa had made a devil’s bargain. She had allowed herself to become well known to publicize her cause, while personally shunning the worldly trappings that accompany celebrity. Suddenly, she
                            seemed not only cranky and demanding, but also hypocritical. 
                            <br> <br> At the
                            same time, her unswerving belief in the doctrines of the Catholic Church
                            and her traditional view of the subordinate role of women within it made
                            her a target of liberal doctrinaires. Nevertheless, with all the twists and
                            turns that celebrity brings, Mother Teresa was unswerving in her belief
                            that she was an instrument of God.
                            So, for all her apparent simplicity, and with all that has been said and
                            written about her, it is still easy to misunderstand Mother Teresa. People
                            in the United States and Europe mistook her for a social reformer, determined to rid the world of poverty and injustice. They were disappointed
                            to find out that she was not intent to bring about social change. She
                            doubtless wanted to help and comfort the poor. More important, Mother
                            Teresa sought to bear witness, to show that even on the wretched streets
                            of Calcutta under the worst imaginable conditions, one could encounter
                            God’s grace and love.
                            <br> <br>
                            In 2003, Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa, the final stage on
                            her journey to sainthood. For many who admired her, canonization was a
                            mere formality; Mother Teresa was already a saint. But her beatification
                            has not silenced critics. Many have, in fact, become more strident, hoping
                            to delay or halt her canonization. There is thus considerable justification
                            for additional study of her life and her work. This biography, then, is not
                            only an examination of Mother Teresa’s life, but of the beliefs that shaped
                            it. The two are so closely intertwined that not to examine them together
                            is to risk missing some essential aspect of this ordinary extraordinary
                            woman.</p>
